# Czech Election 2017

## MEDIAN ShowMe Volby 2017

This web application is based on real application [MEDIAN ShowMe Volby 2017](http://showme.median.cz/volby-2017/). ShowMe was developed with Fable and by me, but it is not my application, so I cannot publish it as my repository here. Second reason for developing this application is limited time for development of the original app - code is not something what I could be proud of.

## Czech Election 2017

So this application is my sample of Fable app where I use some of Fable strengths:

* HTML/CSS/JS framework - **Bootstrap**
* JavaScript library with existing Fable bindings - **React**
* JavaScript library with custom bindings - **Chart.js**
* F# library - **Expecto**
